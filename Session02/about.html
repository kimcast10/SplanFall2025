       <h2>About Lactarius Indigo</h2>
       <p>The fruit body color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue-gray in older ones. The milk, or latex, that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken (a feature common to all members of the genus Lactarius) is also indigo blue, but slowly turns green upon exposure to air. The cap has a diameter of 4–15 cm (2–6 in), and the stem is 2–8 cm (3⁄4–3+1⁄8 in) tall and 1–2.5 cm (3⁄8–1 in) thick.</p>
       <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
       <p>Kingdom:	<br>Fungi</p>
<p>Division: <br>	Basidiomycota</p>
<p>Class: <br>	Agaricomycetes</p>
<p>Order: <br>	Russulales</p>
<p>Family: <br>	Russulaceae</p>
<p>Genus: <br>	Lactarius</p>
<p>Species: <br>	L. indigo</p>

<p>This species is mycorrhizal: It exists most of the time as a network of cells (mycelium) connected to tree roots, in a symbiotic relationship with the tree. (Many trees fare poorly without their fungal partners.) When ready to reproduce, the mycelium sends up the “mushroom” aboveground—this is the reproductive structure. Spores are produced in these structures and are released to begin new mycelia elsewhere. The mycelium of a mushroom can live for decades.</p>
