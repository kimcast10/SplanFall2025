                    <h3>Introduction to Dead Man's Foot</h3>
                            
                              <p>There is wide variation in the shape and size of the species—from round and small ones to humongous amorphous lumps. Do these forms represent different stages of one species or many species with each their own host? Only one species is commonly recognized here in the U.S.A. Until very recently all the Pisolithuses found all over the world were thought to be just one species, but molecular research has shown that there are at least eleven different types, and several species beside those eleven have been described. More work is needed to show whether these are all good species. Some of these molecular types are only found with one host plant species, e.g. Cistus, a shrub in the Mediterranean basin or with Afzelia in Africa. One part of the genus is exclusively Australian, growing with Eucalyptus and Acacia, but now these species can be found far away from the place of origin, wherever Eucalyptus has been planted.</p>

                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <p>Dead man’s foot and Dye ball are two common names for it. You’ll also find ‘tinctorius’ as its species name, referring to its qualities as a dye for wool—this has been known for a long time; Micheli mentioned it already in his book from 1729. Can we assume that even in antiquity it was used as such? Older names for the genus include Polysaccum—the mushroom with the many bags. We can compliment all those mycologists in finding very suitable names for this species. Pisolithus starts out as a club-shaped dark brown object, that when cut open shows those ‘peas’—little compartments in which the spores are formed. Arora described them as ‘Rice Krispies in tar’—a beautiful comparison. In this stage, the mushroom is firm, and wet, and stains your hands. In the next phase the top matures, the outer wall disintegrates and a dark chocolate brown dry spore mass is visible. Those spores are well suited for air transport—they have pigmented hydrophobic walls, and are spiny, real long-distance dispersers. The fruitbodies wither slowly and can, when not kicked, remain in place for months, until only a small depression in the ground might show their former place.</p>

                    <h3>Taxonomic History</h3>
                    <p>The Dyeball fungus was described in 1786 by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Treating it as a puffball, Scopoli gave this fungus the binomial scientific name Lycoperdon arrizon. In 1801 Christiaan Hendrik Persoon retained (but with an 'h') the specific epithet when he included this species with other earthballs in the genus Scleroderma. From 1928 this fungus was known (and still is in some modern field guides) as Pisolithus tinctorius - that specific epithet referring to its use in dyeing fabrics. It was not until 1959 that the Dyeball became generally known by its current scientific name, which was proposed by German Stephan Rauschert (1931 - 1986).

Synonyms of Pisolithus arrhizus include Lycoperdon arrizon Scop., Scleroderma arhizum (Scop.) Pers., Scleroderma tinctorium Pers., Pisolithus arenarius Alb. & Schwein., Lycoperdon capsuliferum Sowerby, Polysaccum olivaceum Fr., Polysaccum pisocarpium Fr., and Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker & Couch.

            <h2>Batch Notes</h2>
            <p>Pisolithus arhizus needs to be emulsified with water to ensure it gets absorbed. I use a special homemade emulsifier my friend Michael Beug gave me but you can easily use some pH neutral dish soap. It also really loves to soak in water for as long as possible. The longer you soak it the more color you will extract. It soaked for 5 days before I cooked up the dye bath. I have never been successful at getting a clear lake from Pisolithus. Pigment settles to the bottom but the liquid is incredibly dark and filled with color. I save this filtered liquid, evaporate it down and use it for ink. It works beautifully.</p>
