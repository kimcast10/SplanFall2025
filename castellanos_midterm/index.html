			<h2>History of the Calico</h2>
			<p>While the origin of Calico cats is not truly known, they are said to have hailed from both ancient Egypt and parts of the Mediterranean like Greece and gaining their famous name from Calicut, India.</p>
			<p>The most known attribute to calico cats are their unique fur pattern, but did you know that they're actually not a breed of cats at all? It's a genetic mutation that creates these patterns within different breeds! </p>
			<p>Calico cats tend to be mostly female as they are the ones that carry two X chromosomes, which lead to the presence of both black fur and orange simultaneously.</p>
